# pyspark

A project to play with pyspark

## Installation 

1. Install hadoop and set `HADOOP_HOME`
2. Get winutils and copy it into `HADOOP_HOME\bin`
3. Install Python and set `PYSPARK_PYTHON` to `python`
4. Install Java and set `JAVA_HOME`


Pyspark may face weird errors, here are the versions that work for me:


| Part | Version |
|-------|--------|
| Hadoop | 3.3.6 |
| Winutils | for 3.3.6 |
| Java | 11 |
| Python | 3.11.8 |
